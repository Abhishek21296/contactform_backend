# Full Stack Contact Form Backend

Welcome to the Full Stack Contact Form Backend repository! This project serves as the backend component of a comprehensive full-stack contact form, designed to facilitate seamless communication between users and your web application. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, Nodemailer, CORS, and HTTPS for secure and efficient communication.

## Project Overview

This project is a part of a tutorial series available on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) that walks you through creating a complete full-stack contact form. The series covers the following aspects:

1. [Part 1 - Building a Full Stack Contact Form: React Frontend](https://dev.to/elenadiaz32505/creating-a-full-stack-contact-form-using-react-and-node-eoh-temp-slug-6816062)
2. [Part 2 - Building a Full Stack Contact Form: Node.js Backend](https://dev.to/elenadiaz32505/part-2-building-a-full-stack-contact-form-from-react-frontend-to-nodejs-backend-553e-temp-slug-1567873)
3. [Part 3 - Building a Full Stack Contact Form: Deployment](https://dev.to/elenadiaz32505/part-3-building-a-full-stack-contact-form-deployment-3o4d-temp-slug-3281173)

## Backend Technologies

The backend is implemented using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, used to handle routing and middleware.
- **Nodemailer**: A module for Node.js applications that simplifies sending emails.
- **CORS**: A middleware for Express that enables cross-origin resource sharing and handles HTTP requests from different origins.
- **HTTPS**: The HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) ensures secure communication over the internet by encrypting data exchanged between the server and the client.

## Getting Started

To get the backend up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder using your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install express nodemailer cors --save`.
4. For HTTPS, ensure you have the necessary SSL certificate files (privkey.pem and cert.pem) and update their paths in the `server.js` file and run `npm i https`.
5. Start the backend server by running `npm run start`.

Make sure to refer to the tutorial articles on Dev.to for a step-by-step guide on setting up the entire contact form project, including the frontend and deployment.
